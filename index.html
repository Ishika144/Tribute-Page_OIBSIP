        <h4>EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION</h4>
        <p>Marie Curie's early life and education laid the foundation for her remarkable scientific career.She grew up in a family that valued education despite facing financial challenges.

            Maria excelled academically, displaying a keen interest in physics and mathematics. However, her aspirations were hindered by gender restrictions in Poland's education system at the time. Undeterred, she pursued higher education at the underground Flying University, an informal institution that admitted women.
            
            In 1891, seeking better opportunities, she moved to Paris and enrolled at the Sorbonne (University of Paris). Juggling financial difficulties and language barriers, she thrived academically, eventually earning degrees in physics and mathematics. It was in Paris that she adopted the name Marie.
            
            Marie Curie's early life exemplifies her determination to overcome societal constraints and pursue her passion for science, setting the stage for the groundbreaking discoveries that would later define her illustrious career.

        <h4>RADIATION RESEARCH</h4>
        <p>Marie Curie's groundbreaking work in radiation research, conducted alongside her husband Pierre Curie, revolutionized the understanding of atomic structure and earned them international acclaim.

            In the late 19th century, the Curies began investigating uranium's radioactive properties. Their meticulous experiments led to the discovery of two new elements: polonium, named after Marie's homeland of Poland, and radium. This groundbreaking achievement not only expanded the periodic table but also laid the groundwork for future advancements in nuclear physics.
            
            In 1903, Marie Curie, alongside Pierre and Henri Becquerel, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their collective contributions to the study of radioactivity. Their work demonstrated that certain elements spontaneously emit radiation, challenging established scientific principles.
            
            Tragically, Pierre Curie passed away in 1906, but Marie persisted in her research. Her dedication culminated in the isolation of pure radium in 1910. Recognizing her exceptional contributions, she received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911, becoming the first and only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.
            
            Marie Curie's radiation research not only shaped the field of nuclear physics but also paved the way for applications in medicine, including cancer treatments. Her tireless pursuit of scientific knowledge remains a testament to her enduring legacy in the world of science.
